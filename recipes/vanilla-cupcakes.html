        <h2> Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter </li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 cup buttermilk</li>

        </ul>

        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients: 
                flour, baking powder, and salt. </li>
            <li>In a second bowl (or bowl of your stand mixer), beat together softened butter and 
                sugar on medium-high speed 5 minutes until thick and fluffy. </li>
            <li> Beat in eggs 1 at a time, mixing to incorporate with each egg,
                 then blend in vanilla and scrape down the bowl.</li>
            <li> Reduce mixer to medium speed and add the flour in thirds,
                 alternating with adding the 1/2 cup buttermilk and beating well between additions.</li>
            <li> Pour batter into 12 lined muffin tins, filling 2/3 full. 
                Bake in the center of the oven at 350 degrees F for 20-23 minutes, 
                or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. </li>
            <li>Let cool 5 minutes in the pan then remove cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li> Once your cupcakes have cooled to room temperature, its time to decorate.
                You are free to use frosting of your choice. Add a bit of sprinkles and your cupcakes are good to go.
